# Activity 1
```{r}
data <- c(-1, 0, 4, 15)
root_data <- sqrt(data)
root_data
```
R gives a warning that the square root of a negative number is not a number.

# Activity 2
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
data(txhousing)
library(dplyr)
glimpse(txhousing)
```
The data set contains 8,602 observations and 9 variables. The variables are
city (character), year (int), month (int), sales (double), volume (double),
median (double), listings (double), inventory (double), and date (double). 

# Activity 3
```{r}
library(gapminder)
data(gapminder)
glimpse(gapminder)
g <- ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = pop, y = gdpPercap))
g + geom_point()
```

There could be strands of data points because there are many countries with
similar GDPs but different populations, and many countries with similar
populations but different GDPs.
