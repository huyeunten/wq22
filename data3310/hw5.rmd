# Activity 1
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(socviz)
p <- ggplot(data = gss_sm, mapping = aes(x = age, y = childs))
p + geom_point(alpha = 0.2) + facet_grid(sex ~ happy)
```

# Activity 2
```{r}
happiness <- gss_sm %>%
  group_by(bigregion, happy) %>%
  summarize(N = n()) %>%
  mutate(freq = N / sum(N),
         pct = round((freq * 100), 0))
p <- ggplot(data = happiness, aes(x = bigregion, y = pct, fill = happy))
p + geom_bar(position = "dodge2", stat = "identity")
```

No, all the levels of happiness are similar between the regions.

# Activity 3
```{r}
library(nycflights13)
p <- ggplot(data = weather,
    aes(x = reorder(factor(month), wind_speed, median, na.rm = TRUE),
    y = wind_speed))
p + geom_point() + ylim(0, 50)
```
