                <b>Blockchain</b> is a digital ledger used to store data. The data is stored in a decentralized 
                database, spread across a network of computers known as nodes (Allena, 1062). When new blocks 
                of data are added, they are verified through a method known as <a href="#proof-of-work">proof of work</a>.
                After verification, each node in the network is updated to reflect the new data (Rodeck and Schmidt). <br>
                Permissionless blockchains are blockchains that anyone can use, and grant users anonymity and 
                security (Allena, 1067). In contrast, permissioned blockchains are more centralized, and trade 
                anonymity for increased efficiency and decreased energy consumption (Allena, 1067).

                <b>Bitcoin</b> is a <a href="#cryptocurrency">cryptocurrency</a> built on blockchain. The phrase 
                “mining Bitcoin” describes how people can earn Bitcoins. Being one of the nodes in the blockchain 
                network to verify the addition of new data will earn the user a certain number of Bitcoins (Lavie). 
                In order for Bitcoins to keep their value as more blocks are added, Bitcoin halving occurs, in which 
                the value of each new Bitcoin is cut in half (Lavie). The current market value of Bitcoin is 
                approximately 44,000 USD per single Bitcoin (CITE).

                    <b>Cryptocurrencies</b> are decentralized digital currencies, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. 
                    Cryptocurrencies can be seen as an investment, or used as legitimate currency at places that accept 
                    it (Ashford and Schmidt).

                In blockchains, <b>hash functions</b> are used to verify the legitimacy of data. Generally, 
                they are one way of encrypting data by using a mathematical function to transform some given information 
                into some other unrecognizable form. Hashing algorithms are commonly used with passwords for security, so 
                that the hashed form of a password is stored in a database, rather than the password itself. Blockchain 
                hash functions are complex algorithms that take large amounts of computing power to calculate (Allena, 1065).

                <b>Non-fungible tokens</b>, or <b>NFTs</b>, are unique, immutable pieces of data generally associated with 
                some sort of digital media (Clark). Like cryptocurrencies, they are also supported by blockchains. They are 
                often seen as digital collector's items, and sell for ridiculously high prices on the Internet (Clark).
